# Auto Guitar Tuner  
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1a539eG_tw&feature=youtu.be" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An automated, microcontroller-driven guitar tuner that detects pitch in real time using digital signal processing and precisely adjusts tuning pegs using a servo-based mechanical interface. Built on the ESP32 platform, the tuner integrates audio sensing (piezo), autocorrelation pitch detection, a TFT-based user interface, and closed-loop servo control to achieve reliable, hands-free tuning.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project implements a fully functional automatic guitar tuner capable of:

- Capturing string vibrations using a piezo sensor mounted to the tuner.
- Digitizing and analyzing audio signals through the ESP32’s ADC at ~8 kHz.
- Identifying pitch using an optimized autocorrelation algorithm.
- Computing cents deviation relative to selectable tuning presets.
- Automatically tightening or loosening tuning pegs via a servo with soft limits.

The system supports:
- Single-string tuning  
- Auto-tune-all mode (fully autonomous tuning of all six strings)
