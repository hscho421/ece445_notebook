An automated, microcontroller-driven guitar tuner that detects pitch in real time using digital signal processing and precisely adjusts tuning pegs using a servo-based mechanical interface. Built on the ESP32 platform, the tuner integrates audio sensing (piezo), autocorrelation pitch detection, a TFT-based user interface, and closed-loop servo control to achieve reliable, hands-free tuning.
